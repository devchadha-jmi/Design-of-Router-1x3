# FIFO Design

- FIFO has a width of 9 bits and a depth of 16 locations.
- FIFOs operate on the system clock and are reset using a synchronous active low reset signal.
- An internal reset signal called "soft_reset" is generated by the SYNCHRONIZER block during the time-out state of the ROUTER.
- When "resetn" is low:
  - "full" is set to 0 (FIFO not full).
  - "empty" is set to 1 (FIFO is empty).
  - "data_out" is set to 0.
- The FIFO memory size is 16x9, with the extra bit used to detect the header byte.

#### Write Operation:

- Data input ("data_in") is sampled at the rising edge of the clock when "write_enb" is high.
- Write operation occurs only when the FIFO is not full to avoid over-run conditions.

#### Read Operation:
- Data is read from "data_out" at the rising edge of the clock when "read_enb" is high.
- Read operation occurs only when the FIFO is not empty to avoid under-run conditions.
- When reading a header byte:
   - An internal counter is loaded with the payload length of the packet plus 1 (for the parity byte).
   - The counter decrements every clock cycle until it reaches 0.
   - The counter holds 0 until reloaded with a new packet payload length.

#### Time-Out state
During the time-out state of the ROUTER:
  - "full" is set to 0.
  - "empty" is set to 1.

#### Additional Notes:
- "data_out" is driven to a HIGH impedance state under two scenarios:
  - When the FIFO memory is completely read (Header + Payload + Parity).
  - During the time-out state of the ROUTER.
- Read and write operations can be performed simultaneously.
