# Design of Router 1x3

This project aims to design a 1x3 router, consisting of various components that will be integrated together. The progress so far and the upcoming tasks are outlined below:

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Individual Design Components
- [x] Design Top Module
- [x] EDA Playground Link for Simulation

## Remaining Tasks

- [ ] Documentation and Architecture of Router 1x3
- [ ] Synthesis on FPGA

## Completed Tasks Details

1. **Individual Design Components**: All the necessary components for the router have been successfully designed. These components serve as the fundamental building blocks for the router's overall functionality.

2. **Design Top Module**: The creation of the top-level module that orchestrates the integration of all designed components has been completed. This module ensures the seamless interaction and proper operation of the router.

3. **EDA Playground Simulation**: The router's functionality has been simulated using EDA Playground. This simulation aids in verifying the accuracy and efficiency of the router's design.

## Remaining Tasks Details

1. **Documentation and Architecture**: This phase involves documenting the architecture of the 1x3 router. The documentation will encompass detailed explanations of each component's purpose, their interactions, and the overarching data flow within the router.

2. **Synthesis on FPGA**: The final step is to synthesize the router's design on an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) device. This synthesis process translates the design into a hardware implementation, facilitating real-world testing.
